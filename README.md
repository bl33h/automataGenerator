## Features

The main features of the application include:
- This is a Python script designed to convert a regular expression into a postfix expression using the Shunting Yard algorithm.
- It imports the regexToPostfix class from a separate module named regexToPostfix.py.
- It defines an alphabet and a regular expression to be processed.
- It creates an instance of the regexToPostfix class with the specified inputs.
- It applies the Shunting Yard algorithm to convert the regular expression into postfix notation.
- It prints the resulting postfix expression and additional information about the conversion.
